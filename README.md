## About the project
### Chagas Disease
In Paraguay, as well as in other Latin American countries, [Chagas disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease)
is one of the pressing issues in the area of public health.

This disease is caused by the parasite [Trypanosoma cruzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi), being [Triatoma infestans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triatoma_infestans) insect or commonly called vinchuca (kissing bug), the main vector of South America.

Currently, there is a concern in European countries and on the United States, due to the growing eco-tourism to South American countries, where Chagas disease is referred to as an "exotic disease".
Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. **A vaccine has not been developed as of 2019**.

Treatment options for infected patients are limited.
Early infections are treatable with the medication if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease.

Most people with the disease live in poverty, and do not realize they are infected.

#### Eradication of Chagas Disease with Technology
> A project in conjunction with the [Center for the Development of Scientific Research (CEDIC)](https://www.cedicpy.com/) and the [Polytechnic School of the National University of Asunci√≥n](http://www.fpuna.edu.py/).

The monitoring of the vector transmitting Chagas disease will be possible through the implementation of a wireless infrared photoelectric sensor network for remote early detection of kissing bugs infestation in a surveillance zone.
Readings of the sensor network will be sent from a ground station to the research lab located in the Polytechnic School using a [satellite](https://birds4.birds-project.com/).
